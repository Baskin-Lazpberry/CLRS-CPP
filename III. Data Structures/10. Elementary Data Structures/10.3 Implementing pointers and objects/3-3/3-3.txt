Q3-3. Why don’t we need to set or reset the prev attributes of objects
in the implementation of the ALLOCATE-OBJECT and FREE-OBJECT procedures?

A. ALLOCATE-OBJECT returns the desirable index where it hasn't occupied yet. Since free list doesn't need any prev pointer,
we don’t have to deal with that attributes. Same to the FREE-OBJECT procedure, free list doesn't use the prev pointer.
