Q1-2.A bit vector is simply an array of bits (0s and 1s). A bit vector of length m takes
much less space than an array of m pointers. Describe how to use a bit vector to represent
a dynamic set of distinct elements with no satellite data.
Dictionary operations should run in O(1) time.

A.
We can use every bit in a vector like every element in an array.
Say we have a bit vector like V[0, 1, 2, ... , m-1], and every bit V[0], V[1], V[2] is 0 or 1.
1 means set S contains that key, and 0 means set S doesn't.
For example, if S contains key {2, 4, 7} when m is 10, the bit vector V is

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
V = 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 (0010100100)

BITHASH-SEARCH(k)
{
    return V[k] == 1
}

BITHASH-INSERT(k)
{
    V[k] = 1
}

BITHASH-DELETE(k)
{
    V[k] = 0
}
