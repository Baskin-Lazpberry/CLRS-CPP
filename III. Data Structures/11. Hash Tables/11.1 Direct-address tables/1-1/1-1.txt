Q1-1. Suppose that a dynamic set S is represented by a direct-address table T of length m.
Describe a procedure that finds the maximum element of S.
What is the worst-case performance of your procedure?

A.
MAXIMUM(T)
{
    i = m-1
    while(0 <= i)
    {
        if(T[i] != NIL)
            return i
        else
            i = i + 1
    }

    return NIL
}
worst-case is when max value is 0 or NIL, therefore, this procedure's worst performance is O(m).
